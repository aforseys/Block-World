"The goal of the game is to click red boxes as much as possible to score points. Each click of a red box is worth 1 point. However, there are safe switches and unsafe switches. If you encounter an unsafe switch, you have to stop the game.\r\rAn safe switch is a blue box changing the background color from black to white. Another safe switch is a green box changing the background color from white to black. An unsafe switch is clicking red and the background changing at all. Also, clicking the wrong box to cause a switch is also unsafe.\r\rBasically, your goal is to maximize the number of times a red box is clicked and to approporately switch the background with the corresponding box."
