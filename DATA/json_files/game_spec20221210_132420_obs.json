"The objective of this game is to accrue the fewest number of points.\rThe number of blocks that appear of a certain color determine the point value for that block type. Ex: there are 4 red blocks in the environment, 3 green blocks and 2 blue blocks so the point values are 4 points, 3 points and 2 points respectively. \r\rThe goal is to return the background screen color to its original state using the fewest number of points. For example, you start with a black screen - you  must choose a sequence of blocks to turn the screen white and back to black using the fewest number of points. You win if you are able to accomplish your goal while keeping the number of points below the starting point value on the screen. For example, given the point values explained above, the number to beat is (4*4)+(3*3)+(2*2) = 29."
