"Start by clicking blocks in the order: blue-green-red.1 point is granted for each correct click in that sequence. When the color of the background changes, flip the order to: red-green-blue. Again, 1 point is awarded for blocks clicked in the correct order. If any block is clicked out of order, 1 point will be deducted. After an incorrect block is clicked, no points will be awarded or deducted until the next correct block in the sequence is selected. The order should continue to be flipped every time the background color changes. The goal is to maximize points within the alloted time. "
