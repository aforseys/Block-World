"Fill Your Block Bag! Goal of the game is to select colored blocks for your block bag by clicking them in any non-color-repeating order, gaining as high a score as possible before your light is snuffed (background turns black). Green blocks are worth 1point, blue blocks are worth 3 points, and red blocks are worth 5 points."
