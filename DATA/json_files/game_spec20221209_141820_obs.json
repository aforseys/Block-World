"The player clicks on one box each step. The score is calculated as number of steps are used when the background has switched 5 times. Particularly, the score function is\r\rtotal_score = 1*num_red + 1.25*num_blue + 1.5*num_green\r\rNote that the player cannot click on the same box on consecutively (same color is ok, but not the same box)."
