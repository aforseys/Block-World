"The objective of the game is to click the blue square as many times as possible while the black background is present and to also click on the green square as many times as possible while the white background is present. Each of these actions results in one point being awarded. However, if the blue square is clicked while the white background or if the green background is clicked while the black background is present, three points are docked from the score. The red square is neutral and serves no purpose other than changing the background color."
